\title{Processes vegetation/canopy cover for a set of polygons using a vegetation/canopy raster
derived from very high resolution multispectral instrument.}
\usage{
get_VEGETATION(
  polygons,
  veg_raster,
  output_path,
  split_threshold = 1850000,
  n_areas = 8,
  id_field = "NAME_ENGLI",
  return = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygons}{An sf object containing polygons.}

\item{veg_raster}{A SpatRaster object representing vegetation/canopy cover with pixel values 1.}

\item{output_path}{A character string, the path to save the results.}

\item{split_threshold}{A numeric value (m^2), polygons larger than this will be split into n_areas.}

\item{n_areas}{An integer, the number of sub-polygons to split large polygons into.}

\item{id_field}{A character string, the name of the unique ID field in the polygons that has to be kept.}

\item{return}{Logical, default = FALSE}
}
\value{
An sf object with id_field plus calculated VegArea and VegRatio attributes added.
}
\description{
Handles large polygons by splitting them into smaller chunks. Runs in sequential mode only.
