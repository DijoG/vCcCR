\title{Calculates Vegetation Cover Ratio (VCr) for each month in a raster stack (annual composite of monthly mosaics)}
\usage{
get_VCratio(inputRAST, inputSHAPE, outputSHAPE = NULL, id_field = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputRAST}{Path to the input raster stack (12 monthly vegetation cover layers)}

\item{inputSHAPE}{Path to the input shapefile (polygons for analysis)}

\item{outputSHAPE}{Path where to save the output shapefile with VCr attributes (default = NULL ~ same as inputSHAPE with '_VCr.geojson' extension)}

\item{id_field}{Attribute name or id to keep, all other fields are removed (default = NULL ~ keeping first attribute)}
}
\value{
An sf object with added VCr columns (invisibly), writes out a .geojson and a .shp
}
